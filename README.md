# AutoML-Optimizer

AutoML-Optimizer is an open-source Python project that automates the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning. It leverages popular libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to learn from CSV data, evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, and automatically find the best-performing model for your task.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**  
  Easily load CSV data, select feature columns and target variables, handle missing values, encode categorical targets, and scale features.

- **Multiple Model Evaluation:**  
  Automatically evaluates several machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and a simple TensorFlow DNN) using cross-validation.

- **Visualization:**  
  Compare model performance visually with bar charts generated by matplotlib.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  
  Uses GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters of the best performing model (except for the TensorFlow DNN, which can be manually tuned).

- **Automatic Task Detection:**  
  Supports both classification and regression tasks by analyzing the target variable type.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
    pip install tensorflow matplotlib pandas numpy scikit-learn
```
Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts to provide the path to your CSV file, select the feature columns, and define the target column:
```bash
    python automl_optimizer.py
```
The script will:

  Load and preprocess your data.
  Evaluate multiple models using cross-validation.
  Visualize the performance comparison.
  Optimize hyperparameters for the best model.
  Output final performance metrics on a held-out test set.
